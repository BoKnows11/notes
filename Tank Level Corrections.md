Questions for Wayne & Tommy:
1. Are the hauling tickets in SF? If so, do you have a query to get hauling tickets built already? 
2. Location map between hauled & piped? Affects how the tanks oscillate - large  step changes (hauled) vs oscillations in a narrow range (piped). May be useful to have different logic for both to determine outliers/erroneous data.
