Questions for Wayne & Tommy:
1. Do yall have a query to get hauling tickets?
2. Location map between hauled & piped? Affects how the tanks oscillate - large step step changes (hauled) vs oscillations in a narrow range (piped). May be useful to have different logic for both to determine outliers/erroneous data.
