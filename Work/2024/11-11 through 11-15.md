Goals of the day:
- [ ] getting the rtu/rp/comp statuses in the pdf. and the other quick fixes above like the cum. deferment line, route stats
- [ ] Area summary pdf
- [x] Pressures beneath prod plot
- [ ] Oil today table
- [ ] begin oil derivative calc (exclude bulk and test locations... for now)
    - If we can get this to flag accurately, could see it being a table beneath the down wells like 'Well Production Dropping'
